# 🏃 Running Activity Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes personal running activity data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about running habits and performance. Using Python's data science stack, the analysis includes temporal patterns, performance metrics, and activity clustering to understand different types of runs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning - KMeans clustering)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

### 1. Data Preparation & Cleaning
- Converted and standardized date/time formats
- Engineered temporal features (year, month, day of week, etc.)
- Handled missing values and data inconsistencies
- Normalized numeric values for analysis

### 2. Running Activity Analysis
- Calculated total running metrics:
  - Total distance covered
  - Total time spent running
  - Total elevation gain
  - Total calories burned
- Identified running streaks and patterns
- Analyzed longest runs and breaks between activities

### 3. Temporal Analysis
- Visualized running frequency over time
- Analyzed distribution of runs by:
  - Month
  - Day of week
  - Time of day
- Identified peak running times and patterns

### 4. Performance Clustering
- Applied KMeans clustering to categorize runs into three intensity levels:
  - Easy Runs - Low Intensity
  - Moderate Runs - Medium Intensity
  - Hard Runs - High Intensity
- Visualized clusters based on distance, speed, and heart rate
- Analyzed characteristics of each run type

## 📊 Key Visualizations
1. Monthly running frequency line chart
2. Hourly distribution of runs
3. Cluster visualization (Distance vs. Speed)
4. Performance metrics over time

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Understand personal running patterns and habits
- Identify different types of runs and their characteristics
- Track progress and performance over time
- Gain insights for future training planning

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Identified three distinct types of runs based on intensity
- Discovered optimal running times and patterns
- Analyzed the relationship between distance, speed, and intensity
- Tracked progress and performance metrics over time
